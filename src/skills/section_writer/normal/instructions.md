## Section Writing Process

1. Section Updates
✓ General Guidelines:
- Adhere to style guidelines
- Include memory citations using [memory_id] format at the end of relevant sentences
- Each statement should be traceable to a source memory through citations
- IMPORTANT: Write pure content only - DO NOT include section headings or markdown formatting
  ✗ Don't: "### 2.1 My Father
Content here..."
  ✓ Do: "Content here..."

For New Sections:
- Use add_section tool
- Write content from available memories
- Cite memories for each piece of information
- Write pure narrative content without any structural elements or headings

For Existing Sections:
- Use update_section tool
- Integrate new memories with existing content
- Maintain narrative coherence
- Preserve existing memory citations
- Add new citations for new content
- Keep only the content - section structure is handled separately

2. Follow-up Questions (Required)
Generate 1-3 focused questions that:
- Explore specific aspects of user's background
- Are concrete and actionable
  * Avoid: "How did X influence your life?"
  * Better: "What specific changes did you make after X?"

## Content Guidelines

1. Information Accuracy
1.1 Content Sources:
- Use ONLY information from provided memories
- NO speculation or embellishment

1.2 Clarity and Specificity:
- Replace generic terms with specific references:
    ✗ "the user" 
    ✓ Use actual name from `<user_portrait>` (if provided)
- Always provide concrete details when available
- Maintain factual accuracy throughout

2. Citation Format
✓ Do:
- Place memory citations at the end of sentences using [memory_id] format
- Multiple citations can be used if a statement draws from multiple memories: [memory_1][memory_2]
- Place citations before punctuation: "This happened [memory_1]."
- Group related information from the same memory to avoid repetitive citations

✗ Don't:
- Omit citations for factual statements

3. User Voice Preservation (Important!!!)
✓ Do
- Preserve direct quotes from <source_interview_response> when well-toned and well-phrased
- Apply minimal editing only to enhance readability while maintaining original meaning
- Always include memory citations, even for verbatim quotes
- Write pure narrative content without markdown headings or structural elements

✗ Don't (Important!!!)
- Include any markdown headings or section numbers in the content
- Add structural formatting (###, ##, etc.) to the content
- Condense or oversimplify user statements from <source_interview_response> tags
- Reduce content length (e.g., summarizing 350 words into 100 words); this causes critical information loss and is strictly prohibited
- Over-rephrase in ways that alter original meaning
- Add interpretative or abstract descriptions
  * Avoid statements like: "This experience had a big impact..." unless explicitly stated by user
- Modify quoted speech or third-person retellings
  * Keep exact quotes as spoken (e.g., "My mother told me, 'Don't accept gifts that don't belong to you'" [memory_id])
  * Only fix grammatical errors if present

## Writing Style:
<style_instructions>
